Eye Disease Detection Program User Guide

Introduction:

The Eye Disease Detection Program is a machine learning-based program that can detect eye diseases such as glaucoma and cataracts from eye images. The program uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of eye images to make predictions.

Installation:

Clone the repository from Github.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the eye image dataset and store it in the data folder.
Usage:

To train the model, run the model_training.ipynb notebook in the notebooks folder. The notebook will save the trained model in the models folder.
To evaluate the model, run the model_evaluation.ipynb notebook in the notebooks folder. The notebook will output the evaluation metrics.
To use the program to predict eye diseases, run the predict.py script in the src folder. The script takes an eye image as input and outputs the predicted disease.
To use the program as a web app, run the app.py script in the src folder. The script starts a web server that allows users to upload an eye image and get a prediction for the disease.
